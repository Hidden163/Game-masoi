# Discord Werewolf
Discord Werewolf is a bot that runs the game Werewolf (Mafia) on Discord. It is written in Python using discord.py. You can find me on Discord as belungawhale#4813.

## Setting the bot up
Install Python 3.5 or 3.6. The latest version of Python that works is 3.6.8, which can be installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/. If you are running on Windows, then be sure to check the box that will add Python to PATH.

Clone this repository. Rename `config.py.example` to `config.py` and `settings.py.example` to `settings.py`, and fill in the fields inside config.py. To change some gameplay-related settings, edit settings.py.

## Dependencies
Discord Werewolf has hard dependencies on discord.py and aiohttp. You can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies. Note that the bot uses an older version of discord.py, but with an additional fix to accommodate Discord's API update.

## Running the bot
You must first create a new bot account at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Put the bot's token inside config.py. Next, add the bot to your server using the OAuth2 link `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8` for faster setup or `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=268536848` for finer tuning of permissions, replacing CLIENT_ID with the client id. If you are running on Windows, run `python bot.py` or double-click run.bat to launch the auto-restarter (it will restart the bot if it crashes for whatever reason). If you are running on a UNIX-based system, run either `python3 bot.py`, or `python3.5 bot.py` or `python3.6 bot.py`, depending on the version of Python that you are using.

## Changelog

11/29/2020 - Credits to Picowchew: Fixed misdirection and luck totems potentially misdirecting to the wrong player, including that the redirected target for misdirection totem potentially being adjacent to the command invoker as opposed to the original target; Fixed the player pool of redirected targets for misdirection and luck totems, and below are some key notes: {The player pool does not include players with the luck totem; Succubus cannot receive a harmful action if the command invoker is entranced; Succubus can be shot, though it will never die by gun, as per the usual mechanics; The player pool for shaman, crazed shaman, and wolf shaman does not include themselves nor succubus if they are entranced (regardless of their totems); The player pool for shaman, crazed shaman, wolf shaman, and guardian angel does not include the players that they targetted the previous night; The target will not be redirected if there are no \[other\] potential targets}; The check conditions for valid targets now all occur before the checks for misdirection and luck totems; Fixed an error from potentially occurring and fixed night potentially not ending, with the result being less kills than expected, when a wolf kills more than one player in a night and either the wolf is given a misdirection totem or one or more of the targets have a luck totem; Vengeful ghost's target can now be affected by misdirection and luck totems; Fixed game loop breaking if a vengeful ghost has the misdirection totem and idles out its night action; Serial killer's target can now be affected by misdirection totem; Fixed serial killer being told the redirected target instead of the original target when targetting someone with the luck totem; Fixed an error from occurring when a piper attempts to charm a player with the luck totem; If a piper passes and then attempts to charm, then it is now told that it has already chosen to not charm anyone tonight, as opposed to being told that it is already charming tonight; If a piper passes and then attempts to pass again, then there is now no response, as opposed to being told again that it has already chosen to not charm anyone tonight; If a piper idles out its night ability, then it is now told that it has chosen to not charm anyone tonight, as opposed to there being no response, and this pass is now logged; If a silenced piper passes and then attempts to charm, then it is now told that it has already chosen to not charm anyone tonight, as opposed to being told that it has been silenced; Fixed guardian angel targetting a dead player allowing it to then target the same person that it did the previous night; Fixed wolf shaman being able to give a totem to the same person on consecutive nights; Fixed wolf shaman being able to give a harmful totem to a succubus when it is entranced; Silenced wolf shaman is now told the totem that it would be able to give if it was not silenced; Crazed shaman's totem is now always logged, regardless of being silenced; Fixed shaman and crazed shaman being unable to give their harmful totems to another player if during the same night, they earlier gave their totems to a succubus and then the succubus entranced them; Entranced shaman, wolf shaman, and crazed shaman now cannot give their totems to a succubus when idling out their night actions, in case of giving harmful totems; Fixed entranced vengeful ghost and assassin potentially targetting a succubus when idling out their night actions; Fixed idled out night actions of shaman, wolf shaman, crazed shaman, vengeful ghost, clone, and assassin potentially targetting a dead vengeful ghost; Fixed game loop breaking if shaman, wolf shaman, crazed shaman, vengeful ghost, or assassin idle out their night actions without any available targets, now resorting to targetting a player with a luck totem, and for the different shaman types, afterwards resorting to targetting the same player as the previous night; Fixed night certainly having to last its full length (and then game loop breaking) if a vengeful ghost has no available targets; If a vengeful ghost does not have any available targets and tries to kill someone, then it is now told like so; If a vengeful ghost attempts to kill itself, then it is now told that suicide is bad, as opposed to there being no response; Fixed amnesiac such that it now abides to its win conditions; Fixed game loop breaking if an amnesiac blocks the bot and is lynched with a revealing totem; Fixed succubus dying by sharpshooter; The logging for serial killer's night action is now similar to that of wolf; Fixed game loop sometimes breaking if more than two players die in a single night in the noreveal game mode; Fixed an error from occurring when a hag invokes the hex command without any parameters; Fixed an error from occurring when the async command is invoked without any parameters; Fixed `basic` appearing in vengeful ghost's living players list when it does not have any available targets; Fixed `diff` appearing in the revealroles command when there are no players in the game; Fixed message formatting of the stats command when there is no active game; Fixed message formatting of the join command when the command invoker has stasis; A bit of code cleanup

Game engine and stuff seems fine for now.; Hopefully fixed players leaving during a game; they spontaneously combust; Added !coin command for decision making; Changed some ordering to make it more fair (remove roles before announcing who was killed). Also unmutes channel before removing player roles so you don't get that weird glitch where you can't talk for a moment; Fixed a bug where anyone, specifically non-players, could start the game; Added !admins to list all admins and did some formatting edits; !admins now lists available admins only; Fixed a bug where trying to lynch a dead player would cause bot to error; Fixed a bug where an end game message would appear twice if !fstop was used
